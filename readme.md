Revealing Module Pattern
The Revealing Module pattern is an extension of the Module pattern that aims to reveal only the necessary public members, while keeping the rest of the implementation private. It helps to encapsulate functionality, provide a clean and organized API, and prevent access to private members.

Usage
To use the Revealing Module pattern, follow these steps:

1. Create an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that serves as the module.
2. Inside the module, define private variables and functions that are inaccessible from the outside.
3. Define public functions that will be revealed and accessible outside the module.
4. Return an object or a set of functions from the module, representing the public API.

## Example

```javascript
const RevealingModule = (function () {
  let privateVar = "I am private";

  function privateFunction() {
    console.log("This is a private function");
  }

  function publicFunction() {
    console.log("This is a public function");
  }

  return {
    publicFunction: publicFunction,
  };
})();

RevealingModule.publicFunction(); // Output: This is a public function
RevealingModule.privateFunction(); // Output: TypeError: RevealingModule.privateFunction is not a function
```

In the example above, we create a Revealing Module using an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE). Inside the module, we define a private variable privateVar and a private function privateFunction. We also define a public function publicFunction that will be accessible outside the module.

By returning an object with the desired public functions, we reveal only those specific functions as the public API of the module. Attempts to access private variables or call private functions from outside the module will result in an error.

To use the Revealing Module, we simply invoke the public functions through the module object. In the example, we invoke RevealingModule.publicFunction() to demonstrate the accessibility of the public function.

## Benefits

- Encapsulation: Private variables and functions are hidden and can only be accessed through the revealed public API.
- Clear API: The Revealing Module pattern allows for a clear and organized API, making it easier to understand and use the module.
- Prevents Collisions: By keeping private members hidden, potential naming collisions with other parts of the codebase are minimized.
